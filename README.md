**Introduction**
AgroValue is designed to bring innovative solutions to the agricultural sector. This project focuses on various aspects of agriculture, providing tools and insights to help farmers and stakeholders make informed decisions.

**Problem Statement**
Title: Development of AI-ML based models for predicting prices of agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetables (onion, potato, onion).

Description:
The Department of Consumer Affairs monitors the daily prices of 22 essential food commodities through 550 price reporting centres across the country. The Department also maintains buffer stock of pulses, viz., gram, tur, urad, moon, and masur, and onion for strategic market interventions to stabilize the volatility in prices. Decisions for market interventions such as release of stocks from the buffer are taken on the basis of the price trends and outlook. At present, the analyses of prices are based on the seasonality, historical and emerging trends, market intelligence inputs, crop sowing, and production estimates. ARIMA-based economic models have also been used to examine and forecast prices of pulses.
